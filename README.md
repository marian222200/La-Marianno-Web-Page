# La-Marianno-Web-Page

A prototype of La Marianno Web Page for pizza delivery. My first try at front-end (back in 2019).

## How to run the project

The client side of the project I ran using this [extension](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server-plus-plus "GitHub: Vscode Live Server++ (BETA)"). For the server side I used [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/ "About Node.js").
To start the server you need to have Node.js installed and run *node server.js" in comand line in the folder where the project resides.

## Main page

The main page consists of the login and register buttons, and a catalog for the avabile pizza. You have to be logged in in order to order and give a rating.

## Login form

If you press the Login button the login form is shown. You need to be registered in order to log in. If you try to enter a non existing email, an alert saying the user is not existent will be shown.
